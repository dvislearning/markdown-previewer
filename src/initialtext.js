Markdown is a simple to use, and elegant way to create easily readable, marked-up text.  Composing markdown can be challenging, however, because you have to guess how your text will look while you're typing it.

**DV's Markdown Previewer** solves this problem!  Simply write markdown to the left, and it will be instantaneously rendered to the right as formatted text.

Most features of Markdown are supported, including: 

* [links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZZ7oFKsKzY) 
* inline code
* code blocks
* list items
* block quotes
* images
* bolded and italicized text


Feel free to use inline html right on markdown.  Just remember to place it around some backticks 

\`<h3>LIKE THIS</h3>\`

Or use blockquotes to provide testimonials about this application

> "It's pretty cool, It's alright. I guess."

You can also use programming code with markdown

\`\`\`javaScript
let emotions=[confused, mischievous];
console.log(emotions);
\`\`\`

DV's Markdown previewer is made with React and is a project in the curriculum of [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer/)`
